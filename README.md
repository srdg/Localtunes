# Localtunes
An offline browser based music app.

Don't ever download a music player again. You just need to have a browser.

## Prerequisites 
Install `flask` using `sudo -H pip3 install flask`.

## Usage
I've loaded a few songs to start with. However, if you want your custom playlist (which I'm assuming you do),  
add the songs to `static/music` directory, and you're good to go!  
To run : download/clone to local PC, navigate to the main directory in CLI and run `python3 main.py`.  
View the webpage on `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Customization
You can also tweak the appearance by changing the files `image1` and `image2` in `static/media`. Make sure to  
keep the names of the file(s) unchanged.

## Preview
If all goes well, the home screen is supposed to look like this.
