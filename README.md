# Localtunes
An offline web based music app.

Don't ever download a music player again. You just need to have a browser.

## Prerequisites 
Install `flask` using `sudo -H pip3 install flask`.

## Usage
I've loaded a few songs to start with. However, if you want your custom playlist (which I'm assuming you do),  
add the songs to `static/music` directory, and you're good to go!  

## Customization
You can also tweak the appearance by changing the files `image1` and `image2` in `static/media`. Make sure to  
keep the names of the file(s) unchanged.
